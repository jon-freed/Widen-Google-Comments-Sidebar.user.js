# Widen-Google-Comments-Sidebar.user.js

Google Comments sidebars are very narrow.

The **Widen-Google-Comments-Sidebar.user.js** "[userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript)" in this repository widens the comments sidebar and thereby improves the readability and usability of the comments.  The userscript does so by adding [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

  **WARNING!**  *Userscripts can be very useful, but userscript technology is inherently dangerous because the browser extension they run within (see below) has access to **every** page you use.  Do NOT install such an extension and do NOT use any userscript unless you are very comfortable with what they are doing!*

## What is a userscript?

A [userscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) can modify webpages while you are viewing it to provide [augmented browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_browsing).  Userscripts, including this one, are typically loaded by and run within a userscript manager browser extension.

## INSTALLATION:

1. First, go install a userscript manager browser extension like [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) or [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/).
1. Then, go to the following URL to install the script:

## NEED SUPPORT?

Go create an [issue](https://github.com/jon-freed/Widen-Google-Comments-Sidebar.user.js/issues).  Please bear in mind that this is free software that has been donated to the public domain through [the Unlicense](http://unlicense.org/) and support may be quite slow in coming.
